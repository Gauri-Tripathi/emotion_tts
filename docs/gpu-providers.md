# GPU Provider Installation and Usage

UniTTS loads GPU providers lazily. Installing `.[gpu]` supplies shared packages
only; it does not install F5-TTS, Dia, Coqui TTS, Qwen3-TTS, or CosyVoice.

The current cluster warning shows that the installed PyTorch CUDA build expects a
newer NVIDIA driver than is available. Qwen still completed, but it took more than
a minute and may have fallen back to CPU. Ask the cluster administrator for the
supported CUDA/PyTorch combination before changing PyTorch in the working Qwen
environment.

Before starting any local GPU provider, run this lightweight check from inside a
Slurm GPU allocation. Do not run a GPU test when it reports `False`.

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda, torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

## Keep Provider Environments Separate

Do not install every GPU stack into the Qwen environment. F5-TTS, Dia, XTTS, and
CosyVoice have independent Torch, Transformers, Python, and system-library
requirements. Create one environment per provider, then install this checkout in
that environment:

```bash
conda create -n unitts-f5 python=3.11
conda activate unitts-f5
cd /nlsasfs/home/dibd/dibd-speech/iitm/triga/experiments/emotion_tts
python -m pip install -e ".[gpu]"
```

Install a PyTorch build approved for the allocated GPU and driver before installing
the provider package. Do not use the commands below to upgrade PyTorch blindly.

## Qwen3-TTS

```bash
python -m pip install -U qwen-tts
```

The default UniTTS model is `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice`. It accepts
named speakers such as `ryan`; its language argument is normalized from `en` to
`english` by UniTTS. This model variant does not support reference-audio cloning
or description-driven voice design.

```python
from unitts import TTSRequest, UniTTS

with UniTTS(provider="qwen3-tts", device="cuda") as tts:
    response = tts.synthesize(TTSRequest(
        text="Hello from Qwen3-TTS.",
        language="en",
        voice="ryan",
    ))

open("qwen.wav", "wb").write(response.audio)
```

## F5-TTS

In a separate environment, install FFmpeg using the cluster-supported mechanism,
then install the official package:

```bash
python -m pip install f5-tts
```

F5-TTS performs best when `reference_text` is the accurate transcript of the
reference audio.

```python
from unitts import TTSRequest, UniTTS

with UniTTS(provider="f5-tts", device="cuda") as tts:
    response = tts.synthesize(TTSRequest(
        text="This is a cloned voice.",
        reference_audio="reference.wav",
        reference_text="Accurate transcript of reference.wav.",
    ))

open("f5.wav", "wb").write(response.audio)
```

## XTTS v2

Use the maintained Coqui package, not the unmaintained `TTS` PyPI package:

```bash
# In a new unitts-coqui environment on this CUDA 12.4 driver cluster:
python -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall \
  torch==2.6.0 torchaudio==2.6.0 \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
python -m pip install coqui-tts transformers==4.57.6
```

`coqui-tts` requires both `torch` and `torchaudio`; it does not install either
one. Their versions and CUDA build must match. The CUDA 12.4 pair above is for
the driver reported on this cluster. Use the cluster-supported pair instead if
your allocated node reports a different driver capability. XTTS is currently
incompatible with Transformers 5.1+, so pin Transformers to `4.57.6`.

```python
from unitts import TTSRequest, UniTTS

with UniTTS(provider="xtts-v2", device="cuda") as tts:
    response = tts.synthesize(TTSRequest(
        text="Hello from XTTS.",
        language="en",
        reference_audio="reference.wav",
    ))

open("xtts.wav", "wb").write(response.audio)
```

## Dia

Dia is installed from the official source repository. Keep it in its own
environment because it can require a different Transformers/Torch combination.

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/nari-labs/dia.git
```

Dia expects dialogue tags. Keep generations moderately sized and alternate
`[S1]` and `[S2]`.

```python
from unitts import TTSRequest, UniTTS

with UniTTS(provider="dia", device="cuda") as tts:
    response = tts.synthesize(TTSRequest(
        text="[S1] Hello there. [S2] Hello back. [S1] Nice to meet you.",
        language="en",
    ))

open("dia.wav", "wb").write(response.audio)
```

## CosyVoice

CosyVoice is source-installed rather than a normal UniTTS extra. Its official
instructions currently use Python 3.10 and repository requirements, so use a
dedicated environment:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice.git
cd CosyVoice
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
export COSYVOICE_ROOT="$PWD"
cd /nlsasfs/home/dibd/dibd-speech/iitm/triga/experiments/emotion_tts
python -m pip install -e ".[gpu]"
export PYTHONPATH="$COSYVOICE_ROOT:$PYTHONPATH"
```

Download a CosyVoice model first, then pass its local directory to UniTTS. The
path must match the model you downloaded. Keep `PYTHONPATH` set for shells that
run the UniTTS CosyVoice provider.

```python
from unitts import TTSRequest, UniTTS

with UniTTS(
    provider="cosyvoice",
    device="cuda",
    model="/path/to/pretrained_models/CosyVoice2-0.5B",
) as tts:
    response = tts.synthesize(TTSRequest(
        text="Hello from CosyVoice.",
        language="en",
    ))

open("cosyvoice.wav", "wb").write(response.audio)
```

## Fish Speech

`fish-speech` is a client for the official self-hosted Fish Speech API, not the
Fish Audio cloud provider (`fish` / `fish-audio`). Keep the Fish Speech checkout
and its model environment separate from UniTTS. The smaller
`openaudio-s1-mini` checkpoint is intended for local deployment; the S2 model
requires at least 24 GB of VRAM.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech.git
cd fish-speech
# Follow the upstream installation instructions for this environment.
hf download fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini --local-dir checkpoints/openaudio-s1-mini
python -m tools.api_server \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --llama-checkpoint-path checkpoints/openaudio-s1-mini \
  --decoder-checkpoint-path checkpoints/openaudio-s1-mini/codec.pth \
  --decoder-config-name modded_dac_vq
```

With the server running, use UniTTS from its own environment. The default
endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/tts`.

```python
from unitts import TTSRequest, UniTTS

with UniTTS(provider="fish-speech") as tts:
    response = tts.synthesize(TTSRequest(
        text="(excited) Hello from Fish Speech.",
        reference_audio="reference.wav",
        reference_text="Accurate transcript of reference.wav.",
    ))

open("fish-speech.wav", "wb").write(response.audio)
```

Pass `endpoint="http://host:port/v1/tts"` to `UniTTS` when the Fish Speech
server is not local. Run the explicit smoke test only after the server is ready:

```bash
python test_gpu_models.py fish-speech
```

## Smoke Tests

The test runner checks whether each optional package is installed before loading a
model. Missing providers are reported as `SKIPPED`, rather than failed. Running a
test does load model weights and can consume a GPU allocation.

```bash
cd /nlsasfs/home/dibd/dibd-speech/iitm/triga/experiments
python test_gpu_models.py --list
python test_gpu_models.py f5-tts
```
